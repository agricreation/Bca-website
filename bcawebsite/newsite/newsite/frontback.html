    <h1>Web Development can be classified into two ways:</h1>
    <p><b>Frontend Development:</b> The part of a website that the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application.</p>
    <img class="frontend" src="img/frontend.jpeg" >
    <p><b>Backend Development:</b> Backend is the server side of a website. It is the part of the website that users cannot see and interact. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data.</p>
    <img class="frontend" src="img/Backend.jpeg" >
    <p><b>Frontend Languages:</b> The front end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
           <b> HTML: </b> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to design the front-end portion of web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text documentation within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>CSS:</b> Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
           <p> <b>java script</b> JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on the sites to make the site interactive for the user. It is used to enhancing the functionality of a website to running cool games and web-based software. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
               <b> AJAX:</b> Ajax is an acronym for Asynchronous Javascript and XML. It is used to communicate with the server without refreshing the web page and thus increasing the user experience and better performance.
            </p>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        There are many other languages through which one can do front-end development depending upon the framework for example Flutter user Dart, React uses JavaScript and Django uses Python, and much more.
