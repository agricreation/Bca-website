  <h2>Bitwise Operators</h2>
JavaScript supports the following bitwise operators,

Assume variable A holds 2 and variable B holds 3, then <br>

<h4>	Operator & Description</h4>
1.& (Bitwise AND)<br>

It performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of its integer arguments.<br>

Ex: (A & B) is 2.<br><br>

2.| (BitWise OR)<br>

It performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments.<br>

Ex: (A | B) is 3.<br><br>

3.^ (Bitwise XOR)<br>

It performs a Boolean exclusive OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments. 
Exclusive OR means that either operand one is true or operand two is true, but not both.<br>

Ex: (A ^ B) is 1.<br><br>

4.~ (Bitwise Not)<br>

It is a unary operator and operates by reversing all the bits in the operand.<br>

Ex: (~B) is -4.<br><br>

5.<< (Left Shift)<br>

It moves all the bits in its first operand to the left by the number of places specified in the second operand.
 New bits are filled with zeros. Shifting a value left by one position is equivalent to multiplying it by 2,
 shifting two positions is equivalent to multiplying by 4, and so on.<br>

Ex: (A << 1) is 4.<br><br>

6.>> (Right Shift)<br>

Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operand’s value is  moved right by the number of bits specified by the 
right operand.<br>

Ex: (A >> 1) is 1.<br><br>

7.>>> (Right shift with Zero)<br>

This operator is just like the >> operator, except that the bits shifted in on the left are
 always zero.<br>

Ex: (A >>> 1) is 1.
